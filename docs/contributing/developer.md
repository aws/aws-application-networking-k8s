# Developer Guide

## Tools

Before you start you need to have following:

- aws account - https://aws.amazon.com/
- aws cli - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html
- eksctl - https://github.com/eksctl-io/eksctl/blob/main/README.md#installation
- kubectl - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/install-kubectl.html
- go v1.20.x - https://go.dev/doc/install
- yq - https://github.com/mikefarah/yq#install
- jq - https://jqlang.github.io/jq/
- make 

After pulling repo toolchain.sh script will install other dependencies.

```bash
make toolchain
```

## Cluster Setup

To run controller in cluster or in development mode you need an EKS cluster. It's a one time setup.
Running controller in development mode will start controller locally and connects to EKS cluster, 
this is preferable way for local development.

Once you have eksctl and aws account you can create EKS cluster. It's handy to set env variables, since many places relies on them.

```bash
export AWS_ACCOUNT= {your account}
export AWS_REGION= {region with eks and lattice}
export CLUSTER_NAME=dev-cluster
```

Create an EKS cluster and allow Lattice traffic into cluster.

```bash
eksctl create cluster --name $CLUSTER_NAME --region $AWS_REGION

CLUSTER_SG=$(aws eks describe-cluster --name $CLUSTER_NAME --output json| jq -r '.cluster.resourcesVpcConfig.clusterSecurityGroupId')
PREFIX_LIST_ID=$(aws ec2 describe-managed-prefix-lists --query "PrefixLists[?PrefixListName=="\'com.amazonaws.$AWS_REGION.vpc-lattice\'"].PrefixListId" | jq -r '.[]')
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id $CLUSTER_SG --ip-permissions "PrefixListIds=[{PrefixListId=${PREFIX_LIST_ID}}],IpProtocol=-1"
PREFIX_LIST_ID_IPV6=$(aws ec2 describe-managed-prefix-lists --query "PrefixLists[?PrefixListName=="\'com.amazonaws.$AWS_REGION.ipv6.vpc-lattice\'"].PrefixListId" | jq -r '.[]')
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id $CLUSTER_SG --ip-permissions "PrefixListIds=[{PrefixListId=${PREFIX_LIST_ID_IPV6}}],IpProtocol=-1"
eksctl utils associate-iam-oidc-provider --cluster $CLUSTER_NAME --approve --region $AWS_REGION

aws iam create-policy \
   --policy-name VPCLatticeControllerIAMPolicy \
   --policy-document file://examples/recommended-inline-policy.json
   
export VPCLatticeControllerIAMPolicyArn=$(aws iam list-policies --query 'Policies[?PolicyName==`VPCLatticeControllerIAMPolicy`].Arn' --output text)

eksctl create iamserviceaccount \
   --cluster=$CLUSTER_NAME \
   --namespace=aws-application-networking-system \
   --name=gateway-api-controller \
   --attach-policy-arn=$VPCLatticeControllerIAMPolicyArn \
   --override-existing-serviceaccounts \
   --region $AWS_REGION \
   --approve
```

Once cluster is ready. We need to apply CRDs for gateway-api resources. First install core gateway-api CRDs:
```bash
kubectl apply -f config/crds/bases/k8s-gateway-v0.6.1.yaml
```

The above command will install gateway-api v1beta1 CRDs. If you prefer using the latest v1 CRDs, you can install them instead:
```bash
kubectl apply -f config/crds/bases/k8s-gateway-v1.0.0.yaml
```
Note that v1 CRDs are not included in `deploy-*.yaml` and helm chart by default.

And install additional CRDs for the controller:

```bash
kubectl apply -f config/crds/bases/externaldns.k8s.io_dnsendpoints.yaml
kubectl apply -f config/crds/bases/application-networking.k8s.aws_serviceexports.yaml
kubectl apply -f config/crds/bases/application-networking.k8s.aws_serviceimports.yaml
kubectl apply -f config/crds/bases/application-networking.k8s.aws_targetgrouppolicies.yaml
kubectl apply -f config/crds/bases/application-networking.k8s.aws_vpcassociationpolicies.yaml
kubectl apply -f config/crds/bases/application-networking.k8s.aws_accesslogpolicies.yaml
kubectl apply -f config/crds/bases/application-networking.k8s.aws_iamauthpolicies.yaml
kubectl apply -f examples/gatewayclass.yaml
```

When e2e tests are terminated during execution, it might break clean-up stage and resources will leak. To delete dangling resources manually use cleanup script:

```bash
make e2e-clean
```

## Local Development

A minimal test of changes can be done with ```make presubmit```. This command will also run on PR.

```
make presubmit
```

Start controller in development mode, that will point to cluster (see setup above).

```
// should be region of the cluster
REGION=us-west-2 make run
```

You can explore a collection of different yaml configurations in the examples folder that can be applied to cluster.

To run it against specific lattice service endpoint.

```
LATTICE_ENDPOINT=https://vpc-lattice.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ make run
```

To easier load environment variables, if you hope to run the controller by GoLand IDE locally, you could run the `./scripts/load_env_variables.sh`
And use "EnvFile" GoLand plugin to read the env variables from the generated `.env` file.

## End-to-End Testing

For larger changes it's recommended to run e2e suites on your local cluster.
E2E tests require a service network named `test-gateway` with cluster VPC associated to run.
You can either set up service network manually or use DEFAULT_SERVICE_NETWORK option when running controller locally. (e.g. `DEFAULT_SERVICE_NETWORK=test-gateway make run`)

```
REGION=us-west-2 make e2e-test
```

For the `RAM Share` test suite, which runs cross-account e2e tests, you will need a secondary account with a role that
can be assumed by the primary account during test execution.
You can create an IAM Role, with a Trust Policy allowing the primary account to assume it, via the AWS IAM Console.

```
export SECONDARY_ACCOUNT_TEST_ROLE_ARN=arn:aws:iam::000000000000:role/MyRole
REGION=us-west-2 make e2e-test
```

You can use the `FOCUS` environment variable to run some specific test cases based on filter condition.
You could assign the string in the Describe("xxxxxx") or It("xxxxxx") to the FOCUS environment variable to run the specific test cases.
```go
var _ = Describe("HTTPRoute path matches", func() {
	It("HTTPRoute should support multiple path matches", func() {
        // test case body
    })
```

For example, to run the test case "HTTPRoute should support multiple path matches", you could run the following command:
```sh
export FOCUS="HTTPRoute should support multiple path matches"
export REGION=us-west-2
make e2e-test
```

Conversely, you can use the `SKIP` environment variable to skip specific test cases.

For example, to skip the same test as above, you would run the following command:
```sh
export SKIP="HTTPRoute should support multiple path matches"
```

https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/#focused-specs
https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/#description-based-filtering

Notice: the prerequisites for running the end-to-end tests success are:
- Current eks cluster don't have any k8s resource
- The vpc used by current eks cluster don't have any vpc service network association

After all test cases running finished, in the `AfterSuite()` function, it will clean up k8s and vpc lattice resource created by current test cases running.

## Documentations

The controller documentation is managed in `docs/` directory, and built with [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).
To build and verify your changes locally:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
make docs
```
The website will be located in `site/` directory. You can also run a local dev-server by running `mkdocs serve`.
