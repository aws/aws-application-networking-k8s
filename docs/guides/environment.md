### Environment Variables
AWS Gateway API Controller for VPC Lattice supports a number of configuration options, which are set through environment variables.
The following environment variables are available, and all of them are optional.

---

#### `CLUSTER_NAME`

Type: string

Default: Inferred from IMDS metadata

A unique name to identify a cluster. This will be used in AWS resource tags to record ownership.

---

#### `CLUSTER_VPC_ID`

Type: string

Default: Inferred from IMDS metadata

When running AWS Gateway API Controller outside the Kubernetes Cluster, this specifies the VPC of the cluster.

---

#### `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID`

Type: string

Default: Inferred from IMDS metadata

When running AWS Gateway API Controller outside the Kubernetes Cluster, this specifies the AWS account.

---

#### `REGION`

Type: string

Default: "us-west-2"

When running AWS Gateway API Controller outside the Kubernetes Cluster, this specifies the region of VPC lattice service endpoint

---

#### `LOG_LEVEL`

Type: string

Default: "info"

When set as "debug", the AWS Gateway API Controller will emit debug level logs.


---

#### `DEFAULT_SERVICE_NETWORK`

Type: string

Default: ""

When set as a non-empty value, creates a service network with that name.
The created service network will be also associated with cluster VPC.

---

#### `ENABLE_SERVICE_NETWORK_OVERRIDE`

Type: string

Default: ""

When set as "true", the controller will run in "single service network" mode that will override all gateways
to point to default service network, instead of searching for service network with the same name.
Can be used for small setups and conformance tests.

---

#### `WEBHOOK_ENABLED`

Type: string

Default: ""

When set as "true", the controller will start the webhook listener responsible for pod readiness gate injection 
(see ```pod-readiness-gates.md```). This is disabled by default for ```deploy.yaml``` because the controller will not start 
successfully without the TLS certificate for the webhook in place. While this can be fixed by running 
```scripts/gen-webhook-cert.sh```, it requires manual action. The webhook is enabled by default for the Helm install
as the Helm install will also generate the necessary certificate.
